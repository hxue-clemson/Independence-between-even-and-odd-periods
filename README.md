# Independence-between-even-and-odd-periods


Let fand g be two (chosen) normalized Hecke eigenforms in S_k.
Let a = L(f, ell1),  b = L(g, ell1), c = L(f, ell2), d = L(f, ell2).
The file fdispo.txt computed |log(a)+log(d) - log(b) - log(c)|.

The data format  is k, ell1, ell2, and  |log(a)+log(d) - log(b) - log(c)|.
The smallest one is 1.6849464846811481591087e-16, happens at k=96 between L(,94) and L(,95).
